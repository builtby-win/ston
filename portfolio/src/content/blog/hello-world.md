🎆 2026 is going to be my year.
I've been vibe coding an insane amount recently, building [import-magic](https://importmagic.app), [back2vibing](https://github.com/snoolord/back2vibing-releases/releases/tag/v0.5.2), and [areyougo.ing](https://areyougo.ing) with my friend Nikita. (We just started building this last Friday on 2025/12/26, thank you 2x Claude Christmas gift 🎄)

I even made my first sale this year on Import Magic. I can't believe someone really paid $90 for an app that I made.

The only problem I've been having is that I'm not marketing at ALL.

Purely coding and building things but not doing anything to share them.

Even though I haven't been sharing things, I really feel the momentum is going to be crazy for me next year.

I paid for Claude Max and I've been going crazy mode, building 4 different projects simultaneously with multiple terminals at once (thanks to [back2vibing](https://github.com/snoolord/back2vibing-releases/releases/tag/v0.5.2)).

I have no idea how to market my stuff, but honestly I've been having so much fun coding and building things, I don't think I can do anything else, so for now...

My plan for 2026 is to start streaming all of my coding sessions on YouTube/Twitch/Instagram/TikTok, uploading the VODs to YouTube, and figuring out how to do some clip farming.

I tried streaming earlier this year but it was so boring because I was actually writing all the code and building features took so long. But now I'm spending all of my time glued to the screen working on so many projects simultaneously that I think the stream will be very interesting because there will always be something happening.

I've been building lots of little marketing funnels too, like sharing my [dotfiles](https://github.com/builtby-win/dotfiles), [Claude skills](https://github.com/builtby-win/skills) that I've been working on, and [my blog](https://builtby.win/blog).

I've been building so many things, it's so fun and invigorating that I can have an idea and make it come to life within a day or two.

I am overall just so hyped about what I'm working on and just need to start sharing because it's pretty friggin' lit.

If you haven't tried Claude Code or Gemini CLI yet, you should get on that ASAP and give [back2vibing](https://github.com/snoolord/back2vibing-releases/releases/tag/v0.5.2) a try. Seriously, it's 5-10xed my productivity. Instead of waiting around for Claude to finish, I just fire up 3-4 more terminals simultaneously and work on more stuff. Or I just watch YouTube while it's cooking and get pinged when it's ready to review.

I also built some boilerplates for building web apps and desktop apps that I've optimized for AI agents to build apps crazy fast.

[boilerplates](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_roG7nfaMGE2RfMg9LKoPFZCzrz6XGuDxYlhag1f56kM)

I used the web boilerplate to build the entire MVP of [areyougo.ing](https://areyougo.ing) in less than 4 days.

2026 is gonna be poggie woggie. Looking forward to it very much.

Thank you for reading.
